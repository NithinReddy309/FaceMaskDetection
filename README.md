# Face Mask Detection System Using YOLOv7

## Project Objective
The objective of your project is to develop a face mask detection system utilizing the **YOLOv7 (You Only Look Once version 7)** model. This system is designed to identify whether individuals in images are wearing face masks or not, which is particularly useful for monitoring compliance with health regulations in various environments, such as public places, workplaces, and events.

## Key Components of the Project

### 1. Data Collection
- Gather a dataset of images containing people wearing masks and not wearing masks. This dataset should be well-balanced and representative of different scenarios, including various angles, lighting conditions, and occlusions.

### 2. Data Annotation
- Label the images in the dataset using annotation tools. Each image should have bounding boxes drawn around the faces of individuals, with labels indicating whether they are wearing a mask or not.

### 3. Training the YOLOv7 Model
- Preprocess the dataset to ensure it is suitable for training. This includes resizing images, normalizing pixel values, and possibly augmenting the dataset to improve model robustness.
- Configure the YOLOv7 model, setting parameters such as the number of classes (in this case, two: **"mask"** and **"no mask"**).
- Train the model using a suitable hardware setup (preferably with a GPU) to expedite the process. Monitor training metrics (loss, accuracy) to ensure the model is learning effectively.

### 4. Model Evaluation
- After training, evaluate the model's performance using a separate test dataset that was not seen during training. Analyze metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, and mean Average Precision (mAP) to assess its effectiveness.

### 5. Inference
- Once the model is trained and evaluated, implement a system that takes image paths as input and uses the trained YOLOv7 model to predict whether individuals are wearing masks. The model should output bounding boxes around detected faces, with labels indicating **"mask"** or **"no mask."**

### 6. Deployment
- Integrate the face mask detection functionality into a user-friendly interface or application, allowing users to upload images or stream video for real-time detection.

## Theory Behind YOLO (You Only Look Once)
**YOLO** is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection algorithm. Unlike traditional object detection methods that may apply classifiers to various regions of an image, YOLO processes the entire image in a single pass, hence the name **"You Only Look Once."**

### Key Concepts of YOLO:

#### Single Neural Network
- YOLO uses a single convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from full images. This results in faster detection times, as it reduces the computational overhead associated with region proposal methods.

#### Grid Division
- The input image is divided into an **S Ã— S** grid. Each grid cell is responsible for predicting a certain number of bounding boxes and their confidence scores, along with the probability of each class.

#### Bounding Box Prediction
- Each grid cell predicts a fixed number of bounding boxes, with each bounding box defined by its coordinates (center **(x, y)**), width **w**, height **h**, a confidence score, and class probabilities.

#### Confidence Score
- The confidence score reflects how confident the model is that a bounding box contains an object, as well as the accuracy of the bounding box coordinates. It is calculated as:
  \[
  \text{Confidence} = P(\text{Object}) \times \text{IoU}
  \]
  Where IoU (Intersection over Union) measures the overlap between the predicted bounding box and the ground truth bounding box.

#### Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS)
- After predicting multiple bounding boxes, YOLO applies NMS to eliminate redundant boxes by keeping only the box with the highest confidence score when they overlap significantly (using IoU thresholding).

#### Real-time Detection
- Due to its efficient architecture, YOLO can process images in real time, making it suitable for applications like surveillance, autonomous vehicles, and interactive systems.
